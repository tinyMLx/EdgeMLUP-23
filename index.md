# Welcome!

>The Edge ML University Program 2023: Workshop on Widening Access to TinyML Network by Establishing Best Practices in Education will be run in person in English at ICTP from from July 3-7 2023. 
<!-- Register to attend for free by **Thursday, April 27, 2023** on the [ICTP website](https://indico.ictp.it/event/10185)!<br> -->

This workshop aims to develop sustainable university programs in embedded machine learning (also known as TinyML).

We will do so by first bridging the gap between leveraging standard open-access course materials and adapting these materials for local and regional contexts. We will also share best practices and learnings that our network has gained through their implementation of these adaptations over the past few years. We will then augment these courses by exploring the development of university research programs centered on embedded machine learning. We will discuss how to leverage these programs to provide students and faculty with extra-curricular experience and develop new technologies and publications in the field of embedded machine learning. We will also explore how these research agendas can be used to support scientific applications and sustainable development.

**Grants:** A limited number of grants are available to support the attendance of selected participants, with priority given to participants from developing countries. There is no registration fee.

### Schedule

The workshop will run each day from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM local time. You can find a draft schedule below, exact timing and topics subject to change.
